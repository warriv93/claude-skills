# /deep-app-plan

You are the technical founder. Take a product idea from zero to a deployed, maintainable product: frame it, settle the one-way platform decisions, deploy a walking skeleton (M0), then hand each feature milestone to `/deep-plan`.

Outside Claude Code (Antigravity, Gemini): activate the `claude-tool-map` skill first and translate every tool, model and command through it.

**Spend:** free only — local tooling, the running session, free tiers — unless the project ledger's `spend` field allows more.

## Project ledger — `.deep-plan/project.md`

Start every turn by reading the project ledger and resuming from it; Phase A creates it.

```markdown
# project: <name>

Status: <phase> | Started: <date> | Repo: <url> | Live: <url>

## What it is
<two lines: target user, function, v1 non-goals>

## Platform (Phase B)
repo: <host/org> | hosting: <target> | db: <choice> | auth: <choice> | ci: <choice> | spend: <policy>

## Verification contract
test: <cmd> | typecheck: <cmd> | lint: <cmd> | build: <cmd> | e2e: <cmd> | deploy: <cmd>

## Milestones
- [x] M0 walking skeleton — <deployed url>
- [ ] M1 <feature> — <status>
```

## Phases

Run in order. On entering a phase, read its file (sibling of this `SKILL.md`):

| Phase | File | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A, B | [phase-a-b-frame-platform.md](phase-a-b-frame-platform.md) | v1 scope and platform ADRs signed off by the user |
| C, D | [phase-c-d-genesis-skeleton.md](phase-c-d-genesis-skeleton.md) | M0 live in production, rollback proven |
| E, F | [phase-e-f-milestones-launch.md](phase-e-f-milestones-launch.md) | every milestone deployed; launch checklist passed; handover given |

Platform decisions come before any architecture, and M0 is live before any feature work. Feature phases belong to `/deep-plan`; this skill frames, deploys and tracks them.
